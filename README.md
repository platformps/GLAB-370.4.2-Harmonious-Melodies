## Instructions:

### Step 1: Set Up the Project
Create a new project folder for the website and give it a suitable name.
Set up a virtual environment in the project folder as described in GLAB 370.4.1.

### Step 2: Install Flask and Other Dependencies
Activate the virtual environment created in Step 1.
Install Flask and any other necessary dependencies by running:

```
pip install Flask
```

### Step 3: Create the Website Structure
Inside the project folder, create the following folders: "templates" and "static."
In the "templates" folder, create the HTML templates for each page: "home.html," "biography.html," "discography.html," "music.html," and "contact.html."
In the "static" folder, place any static files like CSS stylesheets, images, or music files that will be used on the website.

### Step 4: Design the Website Pages
Open each HTML template file in a text editor and design the structure, layout, and content for each page. Use HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 templating to create dynamic pages.
Ensure that the necessary placeholders are included in the templates to display dynamic content.

### Step 5: Implement Routes and Views
Open the "app.py" file in the project folder and import the necessary modules.
Create route functions for each page, rendering the corresponding HTML template.
Implement any necessary logic to pass dynamic data to the templates.

### Step 6: Test the Website Locally
Make sure the virtual environment is activated.
In the command prompt or terminal, run the Flask development server by executing:

```
python app.py
```

Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to test and navigate through the website pages.

### Step 7: Customize and Expand the Website
Customize the templates, CSS stylesheets, and other static files to match the musician's branding and artistic vision.
Expand the website by adding additional pages or features as desired.

### Step 8: Deployment and Submission
- [ ] Deploy the website to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.
- [ ] Submit the deployed website URL or share the project files with your instructor as directed.


Congratulations! You have successfully created a musician's album website with 5 pages. Customize and enhance it further to showcase the musician's talent and engage visitors with harmonious melodies. Enjoy the process of bringing the musician's vision to life on the digital stage!
